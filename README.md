Hello there, I'm George, aka BetaFisch or just Beta. I am 16 years old and I'm programming since 2019.
I'm living in Austria and like the famous Austrian food called "Schnitzel". 
My current projects are: 
- WarLauncher
- DevilClient 
- Xypholia Client

My main programming language is C# and I also know a bit of Java. I can also program in Processing, MCSkript and I also do some HTML Code (no html is not a programming language) and CSS.

I play games like Battlefield, Minecraft, Brick Rigs, Hearts of Iron IV, Stellaris, Space Engineers and stuff like that.
